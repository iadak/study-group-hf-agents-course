However, without more specific information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact article being referred to.\n\nGiven the limited data, I'll assume we're looking for the most viewed dinosaur-related article that was promoted in November 2016.\n\nBased on this assumption:\n- The article \"Early dinosaurs emerged gradually - Nature\" was featured in November 2016.\n- This article discusses the gradual emergence of dinosaurs over millions of years.\n\nConsidering the information provided, it's not clear who specifically nominated this article. However, based on the search results, we can infer that it may have been promoted by Ian Rose via FACBot.\n\nFinal Answer: Ian Rose"
