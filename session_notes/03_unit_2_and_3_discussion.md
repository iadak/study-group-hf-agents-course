## Meeting Purpose

Review and discuss Units 2 and 3 of the HuggingFace Agents course, focusing on small agents implementation and practical examples.

## Key Takeaways

  - Small agents are simpler and more flexible for basic use cases, with code-first approaches often outperforming JSON-based ones
  - Multi-agent systems can improve efficiency by delegating tasks and reducing context window overload
  - Unit 3 builds on Unit 2, creating a more comprehensive agent with multiple integrated tools for party planning
  - Participants are at different stages of progress, with some ahead and others catching up

## Topics

### Small Agents Overview

  - Simplicity and flexibility are key advantages
  - Code-first approach often better than JSON-based for next steps
  - Suitable for simple agent use cases, not complex ones
  - Different types: multi-step, code, and tool agents

### Building Code Agents

  - Example: menu suggestion tool using function-based and class-based approaches
  - Class-based tools recommended for more complex business logic
  - Function-based tools suitable for simpler tasks

### Multi-Agent Systems

  - Hierarchy with manager agent delegating to specialized sub-agents
  - Reduces context window overload and improves performance
  - Example: web search agent and code interpreter agent managed by a main agent

### Vision and Browser Agents

  - Requires more powerful models (e.g., GPT-4 with vision capabilities)
  - Can describe images and identify characters (with limitations)
  - Participants couldn't run these examples due to model constraints

### Unit 3: Comprehensive Agent Building

  - Expanded on Unit 2 concepts
  - Created an agent for party planning with multiple integrated tools
  - Implemented guest information retrieval, weather checking, and model popularity querying
  - Demonstrated how to preserve agent history between interactions

### Practical Implementation

  - Pardeep shared a script-based implementation of the Unit 3 example
  - Showed how to create a more interactive and flexible agent setup

## Next Steps

  - Participants to complete Units 2 and 3 individually
  - Focus on completing Unit 4 (project work) by the next meeting
  - Consider exploring the MCP (Mission Control Protocol) course after this one
  - Brainstorm potential group project ideas for practical application of agent technologies
  - Investigate other agent frameworks (e.g., Agno) and their tool ecosystems for inspiration
