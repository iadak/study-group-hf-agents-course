## Meeting Purpose

Review Unit 1 of the HuggingFace Agents course and discuss implementation challenges.

## Key Takeaways

  - Participants faced API usage limitations with HuggingFace's inference endpoints
  - Local model setup using Ollama was suggested as an alternative to overcome API limits
  - Implementing multi-step tools and improving agent prompts requires careful documentation and experimentation
  - The group decided to focus on one framework (likely small agents) for Units 2-4 before exploring others

## Topics

### API Usage and Local Alternatives

  - Several participants exhausted their HuggingFace inference API quota quickly
  - Ollama was suggested as a local alternative to run models, providing an API for inference
  - Some participants experienced slow performance with local setups, taking 2-3 minutes per run
  - Pardeep's Mac setup utilized GPU acceleration without additional configuration

### Implementation Challenges

  - Changing LLM models in the code resulted in errors (e.g., 404 errors)
  - Some models require deploying inference endpoints, which isn't available for all models
  - Participants struggled with implementing multi-step tools and getting the agent to use them correctly
  - Improving function documentation (docstrings) was suggested to help the agent understand tool capabilities

### Agent Behavior and Debugging

  - Increasing verbosity (e.g., to level 2 or higher) helped in understanding agent thought processes
  - The agent sometimes generated its own code instead of using provided tools
  - Debugging revealed that the agent only has access to function docstrings, not the actual code

### Course Material Review

  - Unit 1 theory was found to be basic and easily understandable
  - The group briefly reviewed key concepts like agents, LLMs, tools, and the think-act-observe workflow
  - Different prompting techniques were discussed (e.g., Chain of Thought, ReAct approach)

### Tools and Frameworks

  - Participants experimented with adding custom tools (e.g., stock price lookup)
  - The course covers multiple frameworks: small agents, LangChain, and AutoGPT
  - The group decided to focus on one framework (likely small agents) for the next units

## Next Steps

  - Participants to complete Unit 1 implementation if not already done
  - Review Unit 2, focusing on the chosen framework (likely small agents)
  - Experiment with local setups (e.g., Ollama) to overcome API limitations
  - Continue working on multi-step tool implementation and improving agent prompts
  - Share interesting implementations or findings at the start of the next meeting

## Action Items

- Attempt to speed up local Olama model execution, explore GPU utilization
- Test Grok API for limited free usage, share findings with group
- Upload modified notebook w/ stock price tool implementation to shared resource
- Read Unit 2 material, focus on one chosen framework (small agents, LangChain, or LlamaIndex)
- Implement examples from Unit 2 using chosen framework, prepare to discuss next week
