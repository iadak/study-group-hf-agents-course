---
## Meeting Purpose

Review progress on HuggingFace Agents course and discuss Unit 4 project implementation

## Key Takeaways

  - Most participants are at various stages of completing Units 1-3, with some starting on the Unit 4 project
  - Project submission deadline is June 30th for course certification
  - OpenAI API usage (~$0.03 for 500 calls) proved more effective than local models for some participants
  - Participants shared challenges and approaches for handling different file types and model limitations

## Topics

### Course Progress Update

  - Participants range from Unit 2 to starting Unit 4 project
  - Some taking detailed notes while progressing through units
  - Project deadline (June 30th) approaching for certification

### Project Implementation Experiences

  - Pardeep: 9/20 correct answers using OpenAI API ($0.03 cost)
  - Challenges with processing YouTube videos, images
  - Uday: 30-40% complete, working on image and audio file handling
  - Discussion on model selection trade-offs (size vs. cost vs. capability)

### Technical Insights

  - OpenAI models more capable of handling file types without explicit tools
  - Formatting inputs (e.g., CSV as matrices) improved results for smaller models
  - Some participants exploring LangChain and other frameworks

### API Usage and Costs

  - OpenAI API: $5 top-up lasted for multiple attempts (~500 calls)
  - No expiration on API credit balance
  - Cheaper models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) sufficient for many tasks

### Learning Approaches

  - Some participants referencing and adapting existing solutions
  - Value in examining execution traces for understanding agent behavior
  - Balancing between writing from scratch and learning from others' code

## Next Steps

  - Complete Unit 4 project before June 30th deadline
  - Share project doubts and questions on Discord
  - Decide next week's focus (bonus units, LangChain, Llama index) via Discord discussion
  - Troubleshoot Discord access issues for some participants
