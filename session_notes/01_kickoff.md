  - Discord chosen as communication platform for sharing progress, notes, and questions
  - Participants have varying levels of experience with AI agents; some already implementing in their organizations
  - Course will cover different agent frameworks (e.g., smolagents, LlamaIndex, LangGraph) with a final project

## Topics

### Introductions and Motivations

  - Participants from diverse backgrounds (e.g., JPMorgan, Adobe, Shell, Oracle)
  - Common motivation: continue learning and stay updated on AI/ML advancements
  - Some participants already exploring AI agents in their work

### Course Structure and Timeline
